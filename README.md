# URL Deconstructor (and Reconstructor?)

A small tool designed to take a URL as the input and break it down into its component parts. This is to help analyse query strings by more easily viewing the key-value pairs.

I may add on the ability to edit the URL details to 'reconstruct' a new, modified URL.

## To Do

- Make styling consistent by changing conditional inline styles to class-based
- Add copy button to table rows to copy values
